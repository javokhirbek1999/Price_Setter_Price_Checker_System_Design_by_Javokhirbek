# Price Setter And Price Checker [System Design] by Javokhirbek

<h4>Today, I have finished my first real world Swing project !!!</h4>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>My this project includes Graphical User Interface(GUI) that is built with one of the most popular Java's Swing framework. But the User Interface is very simple, because I mainly focused on System Design.</p>
My this project includes two programs:
<ul>
<li>Price Setter </li>
<li>Price Checker</li>
</ul>
<h5>Price Setter</h5>
<p>Price Setter - it can be used for setting prices for particular items that are entered. For example: if you want to write a list of items with their relative prices, my this program is for you. You no longer need to write a hundreds of items and their prices on text editors, only thing you have to do, is just to enter the name of item and its price and click next to enter another item. You can enter as many as items you want. And after entering all the items and setting their prices, you have to save the file using the save option that is available on the menu bar at the top of the program. When you click on the save option, the "Save Dialog Screen" will be prompted, at that point you have to save the file entering the file name and select the destionation to save the file. As soon as you finish naming the file and selecting the destination directory, click on the "Save" button so the file will be saved to that directory. So that file will be used by Price Checker.</p>
<h5>Price Checker</h5>
<p>Using Price Checker, you can easily check the prices of item that are written in Price Setter. Just click on the open option on the Menu bar on top of the window and you will see the option "Select File", click on it and Open Dialog Screen will be opened. Next, select the file to that you have written on Price Setter and you will see the Item name that you have written. To see the prce of that item, you have to click "Show Price" button to show the price for that item.</p>
